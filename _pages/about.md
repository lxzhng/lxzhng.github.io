I am an undergraduate at the University of Illinois studying CS and philosophy. Some exciting things I am involved in:
* Philosophy course design with [Professor John Schwenkler](https://philosophy.illinois.edu/directory/profile/jschwenk) for a new introductory-level course on human flourishing in the digital age.
* AI ethics research with [Professor Lav Varshney](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/varshney) for operationalizing autonomy and studying the effects of AI on human autonomy.

Some honors I've received:
* Recipient of the [Howard F. Crombie Award](https://philosophy.illinois.edu/news/2024-05-10t155215/department-philosophy-announces-more-recipients-annual-awards) for distinction in philosophy
* LAS James Scholar Honors
