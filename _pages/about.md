Hello, I'm Alex! I am an undergraduate at the University of Illinois studying CS and philosophy. Some exciting things I am involved in: 
* Philosophy course design with [Professor John Schwenkler](https://philosophy.illinois.edu/directory/profile/jschwenk) for a new introductory-level course on human flourishing in the digital age.
* AI ethics research with [Professor Lav Varshney](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/varshney) for operationalizing autonomy and studying the effects of AI on human autonomy.

Some honors I've received: 
* Recipient of the [Howard F. Crombie Award](https://philosophy.illinois.edu/news/2024-05-10t155215/department-philosophy-announces-more-recipients-annual-awards) for distinction in philosophy
* LAS James Scholar Honors 

I hope that, by the end of my undergraduate years, I make some meaningful contribution to the ethics of AI. I currently intend to pursue graduate school in CS, although I am also open to studying law or even going down the bleak, mostly hopeless path of becoming a philosophy professor. 

Outside of school, I help to create a space for Chinese-speaking students to talk about faith, life, and God. I also like playing around with open-source software (this website uses the template [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) edited with [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) in [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com)) and doing graphic design work for anybody who needs it.

Beyond philosophy, I have deep respect for music. Composers like Liszt, Rachmaninoff, and Scriabin seem to communicate things outside of the grasp of rational inquiry.
