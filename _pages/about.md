I am an undergraduate at the University of Illinois studying CS and philosophy. Some exciting things I am involved in: 
* Philosophy course design with [Professor John Schwenkler](https://philosophy.illinois.edu/directory/profile/jschwenk) for a new introductory-level course on human flourishing in the digital age.
* AI ethics research with [Professor Lav Varshney](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/varshney) for operationalizing autonomy and the effects of AI on human autonomy.
* Outside of class, I help to run [Alpha](https://alphausa.org/about/) for Chinese-speaking students at UIUC. 

What motivates me is a belief that humans beings are the coolest beings in this universe. 

Beyond philosophy, I have respect for music. Composers like Liszt, Rachmaninoff, and Scriabin seem to communicate things outside of the grasp of rational inquiry. I also like playing around with software (I'm writing this in [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs)).
