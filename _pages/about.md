I am an undergraduate at the University of Illinois studying CS and philosophy. Some exciting things I am currently involved in: 
* Philosophy course design with [Professor John Schwenkler](https://philosophy.illinois.edu/directory/profile/jschwenk) for a new introductory-level course on human flourishing in the digital age.
* AI ethics research with [Professor Lav Varshney](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/varshney) for operationalizing autonomy and the effects of AI on human autonomy.
* Outside of class, I help to run [Alpha](https://alphausa.org/about/) for Chinese-speaking students at UIUC. 

In this blog, I plan to write about ideas that interest me. For some reason, I'm currently interested in meta-philosophy. So I want to write about:
* Doubt; the instinct to doubt, doubt as a philosophical tool
* Fate; the specific world we live in, the specific words in this sentence
* Action; the impulse to read from this word to this word to this word
