title: "Broadly Construed, broadly construed"
---
I expect this website to be a place to pretend that I'm writing essays for some unknown audience to read. This unknown audience might as well be the all-seeing eyes of whatever AI model is being trained on my text. I'm okay with that. 

I want to write about topics in *meta-philosophy*. What impulses and instincts do we rely on when we do philosophy? 

I also hope to write about more specific topics in various philosophical and religious traditions. Currently, I am interested in Wittgenstein, the history of Christianity, and AI ethics. It's a wild combination of things to be interested in. 

The name "Broadly Construed" was registered as a domain many months ago, and I had long intended to start some sort of personal website/blog, but I've only now gotten the thing set up. Let's see how it goes.

“Start a blog.” “Your ideas are so interesting—have you thought about starting a blog?” “If you started a blog I would definitely read it.”

No one has ever said these words to me. And yet here I am, watching these letters clump into words as my fingers type. 

That blinking cursor. A snail. Its trail of letters. The snail snails across the plane of reason, leaving a mark of slimy words that stick together not because they make sense together but because that’s just what the snail does. The snail snails. 

Soon the snail will stop, and rest, and look back on its trail of words. “This would be a good blog post”, the snail thinks. Then the snail gets going again on its next blog post. 

Slowly, this plane of reason will have slimy trails scratched on its surface. Maybe you, my Only Reader, will look at these trails and think they’re very good trails of words. Maybe you’ll see them for what they are—snail mucus. But in any case the snail has begun its journey and only time can tell what the snail will leave behind. 

To You, not you, but You, with a capital ‘Y’; to that solipsistic truth that you’re truly my Only Reader,\
Alex, snail
